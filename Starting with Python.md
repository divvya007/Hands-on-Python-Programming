## Starting with Python 3.x


 * Here I'll be using Jupyter notebook as integrated development environment(IDE) instead of Python's interactive shell, it can be downloaded by downloading anaconda :

 I like jupyter notebook as it is easy to use but any IDE can be used like :
 Pycharm, Spyder or any other computing notebook.
