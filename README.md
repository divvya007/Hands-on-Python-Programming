# Learning Python :

For a non-programmer its difficult to choose a language that is easy to pick up.
So if you have never programmed before Python can be a good start as it is:

* High level language.

* Open source(free to download from http://python.org)

* Easy to learn has simple syntax.

* It has many applications for instance - web & internet      development, data analysis/visualisation, machine learning among many.

* It has large set of standard library.

* Reference material easily available online.

## Starting with basics :

It is important to build your logic first to start coding instead of learning syntax and use it.


* What Programming is?
     Set of instructions or sequence of instructions that user specifies to carry out computation.

* Purpose of Programming?
     Perform actions or tasks that are time consuming and complicated for humans.

* Data Types : important data types are:-

    * String (str) : Combination of characters can contain spaces and numbers as well. Eg;  "Hello" , "bye" , " " , "1".

    * Integers (int) : Used for whole numbers. Eg; -2, -1, 0, 1, 2

    * Float : Numbers containing decimal points. Eg; 1.0,
    1.1, 2.8

    * Boolean : Used for logical expression i.e True or False.

* Variables :

Can be any data type and stores single value. It is important to give a meaning name to variable as it makes program readable.
    Some Rules to follow :

    * Remember variables are case sensitive.

    * Doesn't start with numbers.

    * Doesn't contain spaces so use underscore _ or *camelCase*.
